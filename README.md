This is an example app for the TrustedIntents library.  It is a library for
flexible trusted interactions between Android apps.  It is modeled after
Android's `signature` protection level for permissions.  The key difference is
that the framework allows the trusted signature to be set, rather than
requiring to match the current app's signature.
